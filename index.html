              <h2> Ky Tran</h2>
              <p><strong> Hi! My name is Ky, and I am a 2nd year Computer Science major with
                threads in Information Internetworks and Intelligence.
                I am also minoring in Leadership Studies with concentrations in Business Leadership. 
                I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and I have lived in Marietta, GA for 10 years now. 
                I am passionate about working on projects that simplifies people's lives,
                such as being in charge of the website for my band sorority or building a full website for a Hackathon
                to increase AT&T's 5G outreach. In my free time, I enjoy working out, watching College Football and soccer,
                and play music.
